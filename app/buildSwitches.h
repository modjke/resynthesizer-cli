Compiling switches.

!!! Inner engine is now independent of GIMP, not: #include <libgimp/gimp.h>

The GIMP plugin resynthesizer (an engine, but wraps inner engine) depends on:
GNU build system, gimp.h, and glib.h.

There are three configurations:

1) resynthesizer plugin and engine uses gimp and glib and not glibProxy (original configuration)
2) resynthesizer plugin uses gimp but engine uses glibProxy to redefine most of glib
	(This is for testing using a gimp plugin harness to the gimp independent engine and glibProxy)
3) libsynth.a (inner engine) uses glibProxy, not gimp or glib.  (platform independent engine.)

Threading.

Whether threading is POSIX threads or glib threads depends on SYNTH_USE_GLIB

On other platforms not having glib, define SYNTH_THREADED TRUE and use glibproxy
The latter has not been tested.
